# Lectionary

This is a library that provides all of the tools needed for generating lectionary readings. It is based on the Revised Common Lectionary (RCL) but will expand in the future.

### Tools

- `verse-splitter`: This tool takes a particular verse and splits it into its parts for lectionary usages. For example, it will split Gen 2:4 into parts a and b using a lemmatized version of the KJV as a reference.
